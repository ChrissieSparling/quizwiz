as a user I want to take a timed quiz.
I want it to supply questions and answers.
if a question is missed the timer will subtract 10seconds from the remaining time.
if you get a question correct the timer will continue to go down but no penalty for time.

as a user I want to have a stored highscores page.
I want to be able to restart the game 
I want to store my initials into the highscores section.

css-was added for beauty elements

js- added javascript to shift through the multiple choice questions and provide answers. also- negates time when you answer wrong.

html- highscores was created to save the highscores and make the sight competive and enjoyable

scores.js was to retrive and store the scores
(but isn't working correctly,because it's having a moment)
